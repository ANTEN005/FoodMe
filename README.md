Functional specification:


FoodMe is a website where you can share pictures of your food aswell as sharing and storing your recipes.
Since a lot of recipes comes from other webpages I would also like to create a way so that these recipes
also can be stored on FoodMe but when you click on them you get redirected to the orginal recipe webpage.

To get access to FoodMe the users need to create an acount so that they can log in. When logged in
the functionality will kind of remind you of Facebook. There will be a feed which updates whenever
a friend adds a new picture or recipe. You will also have a profilepage where you can upload recipes and 
photos. And also a page where you can find other users and make a friend request to them. This
is the basic functional aspects of the website, it will work as a social media but for food only.

Technological specification:


The fronend will be created with React since the reuse of components will make my work
a lot smoother with this website. As time goes by I will add third-party libraries that 
I also will work with. Besides React I will also use Redux.

The backend will be created by using Node.js and the framework Express. The user data will be stored
in a MongoDB. When developing the backend I will use Postman for a smoother development.

I have not decided yet if I might try out other deployment systems/platforms, this is probbably
something I have to look in to later on.
